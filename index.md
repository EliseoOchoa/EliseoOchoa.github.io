Hello, I am a computer science major at CSUF and I plan on graduating in 2028

## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 2 part-1: This lab was one of my favorites as it was the beginning of learning harder coding in my opinion. It was the first Madlib.cc games we did, and we also built up on it through out the semester. The first lab, although an appropriate introduction, was just not enough to create a desire of learning like the others have. 

Lab 4 part-1: This lab was one of my favorites as it seems actually useful, as it was the conversion from table units into each other and I probably will be using this in the future for either reference to future code or just when needed to convert units of measurement

Lab 12 part-1: This lab was definitely my favorite lab as it was the most challenging and definitely put everything I knew to the test. This was the making a gif lab and was definitely the  most interesting as it was one of the most rewarding as it was easy to see the results.
